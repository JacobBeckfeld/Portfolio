            About Me 
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Jacob Beckfeld and I'm an upcoming full stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I am working at a bar called Ray J's in Woodbury, MN, but I've decided to pursue a different path with coding. I've worked in the service industry since I was 14 and am both excited and nervous about changing career paths. I can't wait to find out what happens in the future!</p>
